I am a Master's student in Machine Intelligence. I am enthusiastic, in search of knowledge and passionate about the world of science in general. My daily routine consists of trying to understand machine learning algorithms and apply them to real data in various fields.

My main objective is to use machine learning approaches to extract important information and help in making informed decisions, because I believe that satisfaction is greater when the work we do positively impacts and helps people around us.
